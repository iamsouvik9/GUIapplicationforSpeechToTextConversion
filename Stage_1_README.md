# GUIapplicationforSpeechToTextConversion


Stage 1:
1. Here it is a simple desktop application that will enable us to convert an audio to text.
2. For building up the GUI application I have used the Tkinter library in Python.
3. And for text transcription I have used the SpeechRecognition library to do the Transcription part.
